Prepare the F5 Extension
===========================

The rest of the lab we will be working with the F5 Automation Toolchain. This
is a set of declarative API endpoints that you can install on top of TMOS to
allow you to more simply manage BIG-IPs through an API. As part of the 
Google Cloud Terraform module, these modules will be installed by default. Navigate in
the TMUI to "iApps -> Package management LX" and you'll see four packages (The
fifth is Service Discovery and is now a subset of AS3):

The terraform apply you performed in the last step generated the necessary
declaration files for rest of the lab. They are located under the
f5-agility_GC_Terraform_ATC/ATC_Declarations folder.

Connect the F5 Extension to the BIG-IPs
---------------------------------------

The first step will be to configure the F5 Extension to connect to the two
BIG-IPs

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-SelectF5Extension.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Select F5

Copy bigip_1_host information then click on add host then paste and enter.

.. warning:: There is a bug that when you use the mouse buttons in the password 
   input, it will disappear without taking any information.  Should you overlook 
   this warning block, simply refresh the browser window that vscode is running in and 
   you can enter it by using the keyboard. 

Once the name loads on the side column click on the host and paste in the
bigip_password.

Do the same for big-ip 2.

.. warning:: In both labs where you are making Declarative Onboarding (DO) posts, 
   it is critical to verify that you are connected to the correct BIG-IP 
   based on the IP Addresses from the terraform output.  Keeping your terminal 
   window with the terraform output visible can minimize the risk of selecting the 
   wrong BIG-IP when moving between them in this lab.

Submit Declarative Onboarding declarations
------------------------------------------

From f5-agility_GC_Terraform_ATC click on Lab4.1-DO under the drop down menu,
select "do_BIGIP1.json" request.

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP1.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Add BIG-IP1

Make sure that your "target" is BIG-IP1:

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP1_Verification.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: BIG-IP1 target

Right Click "Post as DO Declaration". The Status will return as "200 SUCCESS" or "202 RUNNING".

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP1PostasDO.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Post as DO

.. image:: ./images/PostingDO_Message.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Post DO

Check the status of DO by ckicking on the DO(1.30.0) in the white bar at the
bottom.

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP1_VerificationDOCheck.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Add BIG-IP1

Wait a few minutes until status is 200 OK

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP1_Success.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Add BIG-IP1

At the bottom of the VS Code window in the white bar, you can click on the DO
(1.30.0) to submit a "GET" request to get the status of the DO execution as you
did above. Wait until you get a status of "200 OK."

Now sign into BIG-IP Host 2 by clicking on the F5 Extension icon and left clicking on
the second BIG-IP. 

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-F5ExtensionSwitchunit.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: F5 Extension switch devices

Now return to the folder explorer and click on Lab4.1-DO under the drop down menu, select
"do_step2.json" request. Right Click "Post as DO Declaration".

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP2PostasDO.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Add BIG-IP2

Wait a few minutes until status is 200 OK

.. image:: ./images/Lab4.1-DO-BIGIP2_Success.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Add BIG-IP2

.. note:: Even though you just sent a DO declaration to the device, the status bar from 
   the F5 Extension still reflects the name set on initial start up. This will get updated 
   the next time you connect to that device.
