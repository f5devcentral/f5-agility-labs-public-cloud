Login to F5's lab platform (Unified Demo Framework)
===================================================

Follow the link in your email invite and login to the lab environment.

Your Deployment => Systems => Client => Access => VS Code.

Prepare the VSCode environment
----------------------------------------------

Visual Studio Code will launch as a tab in your current browser. VS Code is
running from a remote machine in your UDF environment.  When the window loads, it 
will prompt you to trust the files in the folder.  Check the box and click yes.

.. image:: ./images/Trustfolder_LaunchVSCODE.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Trust folder dialog

Now you will need to open a new terminal window. 

.. image:: ./images/02_VSCode_NewTerminal.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Launch new terminal

The terminal window will be at the bottom of the screen.  Make sure the Terminal
window indicates a "bash" shell.

Authenticate the 'gcloud' command line utility
----------------------------------------------

From the VS Code terminal run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   gcloud auth application-default login

If you copied this command and tried to paste it into the terminal window, you will be prompted to allow access to the clipboard.

.. image:: ./images/VSCode_allowClipboard.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Allow Clipboard Access


This will give you a link you can click on (or CMD-click) to open up a browser,
prompting you to associate your Google account with the gcloud command utility.

.. image:: ./images/GcloudAuth_tokenRequestVSCode.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Gcloud auth token request 

.. warning:: The Google account you use must be identical to the user you signed
   up for Agility and signed into this account with. Otherwise you will not
   have access to the F5 Google Cloud Account built for this class.

.. image:: ./images/GcloudAuth_accountselection.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Choose your Google account

Select "Allow" in order to trust this gcloud instance

.. image:: ./images/GcloudAuth_allow.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Gcloud Allow

The browser will give you an authentication token to copy and paste back into
the VS Code Terminal.  Paste into the terminal and gcloud will be successfully
authenticated and will work for Terraform.

.. image:: ./images/GcloudAuth_tokenCopy.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Gcloud copy the token

Copy the token back into the VS Code terminal window, you may get a warning to
have the VS Code browser implementation to see your clipboard. Please select
"Allow" or you will have a lot of intricate typing to do.

.. image:: ./images/VSCode_allowClipboard.png
   :scale: 100%
   :alt: Allow access to the clipboard

The pasted token will look like this:

.. image:: ./images/GcloudAuth_tokenCopyVSCode.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Gcloud token copied into VSCode

Once you click "Enter," gcloud will now be able to operate against the Agility
Google Cloud account. The gcloud authorization will also allow Terraform to use the
gcloud credentials to operate against Google Cloud.

Deploy F5 VE and a complete application environment to Google Cloud with Terraform
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the Visual Studio Code Terminal, clone the github repository for this lab
and change to the working directory.

.. warning:: For a smooth ride, always invoke commands from inside the cloned
   git repository (f5-agility_GC_Terraform_ATC). To check you're in the right
   place, you can run the command ``pwd`` and the output should read
   ``/home/ubuntu/projects/f5-agility_GC_Terraform_ATC``

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-agility_GC_Terraform_ATC.git
   cd f5-agility_GC_Terraform_ATC/

.. image:: ./images/gitCloneRepoResults.png

Build two BIG-IPs using Terraform
---------------------------------

The first step that needs to be done is update the variable "student_id" in the
terraform.tfvars file.  Please use the assigned Student ID.

.. image:: ./images/module1_terraform_Set_tfvars.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: tfvars

.. warning:: A failure to change the value of 'student_id' on line two of
   terraform.tfvars to your assigned ID will result in your lab failing, or
   colliding with another student's lab.

You will need to initialize Terraform and allow it to download all required
modules. Do so by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform init

.. image:: ./images/module1_terraform_Init1.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Terraform init part1

.. image:: ./images/module1_terraform_Init2.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Terraform init part1

Once initialized, We will run a terraform plan which will let terraform
identify the resources that it will be creating. Please run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform plan

.. image:: ./images/module1_terraform_Plan.png
   :scale: 60%
   :alt: Terraform plan

.. note:: You will see a warning about line 106 in the main.tf file.  This is due to our 
   choice to have the system generate the password and use that in the build out 
   for the sake of time and reducing steps in the lab.

The last step of launching terraform is to "apply." Note that this will take
some time and will prompt you (by default) to proceed. Please run the following
and respond with 'yes' when prompted.

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform apply

At the end of the 'terraform apply' you will receive what terraform calls
outputs. These are defined in the terraform variables. You can always get the
'terraform output' values again by invoking from the terminal, make sure to
have bash toggled:

.. image:: ./images/module1_terraform_ApplyComplete.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: tf apply

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform output bigip_password
   terraform output

Due to changes in terraform 1.x, the sensitive values are not output with the 
general output command, however if you specify the sensitive output value 
name, it will return that value.

.. image:: ./images/Module1_terraform_Output.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: tf output

Login to Google Cloud App
--------------------

Click on "Firefox" under access methods (or use your own local browser if able)
and navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com with the e-mail address that
you signed up for Agility with, and you just signed in to authenticate with
'gcloud.'

Once your terraform apply has finished, navigate to "Compute Engine" -> "VM
Instances" and locate your BIG-IP instances denoted by
"studentX-Y-YYYY-f5vm0[1,2]." These are your BIG-IP units running within Google Cloud

.. warning:: We will be returning to lecture at this point of the lab. We will
   allow the BIG-IPs to start up for all students during the lecture.
