App Deployment using Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) --- CARL
================================================================================

We begin our journey with Application Services 3 Extension by first examining a working 
configuration and converting it into an AS3 Declaration.  You will be using a free, multiplatform tool
from Microsoft called VS Code along with some extensions that make these tasks much easier.

In this module, you will:

-  Install extensions into VS Code.
-  Learn about the F5 Extension.
-  Use the VS Code F5 Extension to convert an application configuration to Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) format
-  Deploy an application using AS3
-  Learn how to update an F5 Automation Toolchain extension

.. note::

   This module does not cover HA clustering/failover configuration. That will be done in a later module.
