App Deployment using Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) --- CARL
================================================================================

We begin our journey with Application Services 3 (AS3) Extension by first examining a working 
configuration and converting it into an AS3 Declaration. You will continue to use VS Code, along 
with some extensions that make these tasks much easier.

In this module, you will:

-  Install extensions into VS Code.
-  Learn about the F5 Extension.
-  Deploy applications using AS3
-  Use the VS Code F5 Extension to Examine a system and convert an application to an Application 
-  Services 3 Extension (AS3) declaration

.. note::

   This module does not cover HA clustering/failover configuration. That was already done in the 
   initial Terraform deployment using DO.
