Lab Environment Access and Initial Setup
================================================================================

This lab makes use of two environments:

- F5 Unified Demo Framework (UDF)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud

First, you must log into the F5 UDF portal and use a Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)) client to access a Windows jump host. The jump host will have all of the tools and credentials necessary to deploy SSL Orchestrator in AWS.
