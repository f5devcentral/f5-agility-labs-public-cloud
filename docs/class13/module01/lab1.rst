Login to F5's lab platform (Unified Demo Framework) and launch a remote desktop session
=======================================================================================

Follow the link in your email invite and login to the lab environment.

Under win2019, from the ACCESS drop-down, select RDP and resolution. The lab looks best in FHD (1920 x 1080). This will download the rdp file to your computer. Launch the RDP file and login via RDP using the credentials below.

.. attention::

  Before proceeding, wait 30 seconds for the Visual Studio Code and Postman applications to start automatically.

You can run the entire lab from within the Windows jump host.

Visual Studio Code => View => Terminal

You will see:
  - AWS Console URL
  - AWS Console Username
  - AWS Console Password

Maximize the Terminal Window by clicking on the ^ in the upper-right-hand corner of the Terminal.

Login to AWS Console
====================

A URL shortcut has been auto-generated on the Windows desktop: "**{AWS Account ID}** AWS Sign-In".

First, launch Firefox from the taskbar, then click on the "**{AWS Account ID}** AWS Sign-In" URL shortcut on the Desktop.

If the Firefox resolution in your RDP session renders components off-screen, try to first launch Firefox from the taskbar *before* you click on the "**{AWS Account ID}** AWS Sign-In" URL shortcut on the Desktop. 

Alternatively, you can CTRL+click the "AWS Console URL:" https shortcut in the Visual Studio Code terminal.

Login to the AWS web console with the credentials shown in your terminal.

  :scale: 50%

.. attention::

  In the upper-right-hand corner, confirm you are in the correct region (lab will run in US-West (Oregon) / us-west 2 region by default)

"Services" => type "marketplace" in the search window. Select "AWS Marketplace Subscriptions" from the search results. Right-click on "Manage subscriptions" to open a new tab.
=> "Discover products"
Type "f5 advanced 25mbps" in the search box. => "F5 Advanced WAF with LTM, IPI, and Threat Campaigns (PAYG, 25Mbps)" => "Continue to Subscribe" => "Accept Terms"

Deploy F5 Virtual Editions and a complete application environment to AWS with Terraform
=======================================================================================

From the Visual Studio Code Terminal, clone the github repository for this lab and change to the working directory.

.. attention::

  For a smooth ride, always invoke commands from inside the cloned git repository (f5agility2022-pc201). To check you're in the right place, you can run the command ``pwd`` and the output should read ``/home/f5admin/f5agility2022-pc201``

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/tmarfil/f5agility2022-pc201.git
   cd f5agility2022-pc201/

.. image:: ./images/9_vscode_git_clone.png
  :scale: 50%

Run the start.sh script to set environment variables and make the ./scripts directory executable

.. code-block:: bash

    source ./start.sh

.. image:: ./images/9_vscode_git_clone_source_start.png
  :scale: 50%

Create an SSH key and upload to your AWS account. We'll later use this key to connect to our F5 instances.

.. code-block:: bash

  create-ssh-keys.sh

.. image:: ./images/10_vscode_create_ssh_key.png
  :scale: 50%


From the AWS Console, make sure you are in the us-west-2 (Orgeon) region.

.. image:: ./images/14_verify_us-west-2_region.png
  :scale: 50%

From the AWS Console => Services => EC2 => Key pairs. Confirm your ssh key was created.

Initialize Terraform modules.

.. code-block:: bash

    terraform init

.. image:: ./images/11_vscode_terraform_init.png
  :scale: 50%

Validate Terraform files.

.. code-block:: bash

    terraform validate

.. image:: ./images/12_vscode_terraform_validate.png
  :scale: 50%

Create a terraform dependency graph.

.. code-block:: bash

    create-terraform-dependency-graph.sh

.. image:: ./images/13_vscode_create_terraform_dependency_graph.png
  :scale: 50%

From the Windows desktop, click on the "terraform_dependency_graph" URL shortcut. Review in your browser. Terraform tracks the dependencies of all of the objects in your environment. This is one of the major advantages to using a declarative tool for building infrastructure and services.

From the Visual Studio Code Terminal

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform plan -var 'bigip_admin_password=f5letme1n'
   terraform apply -var 'bigip_admin_password=f5letme1n' -auto-approve

.. image:: ./images/16_vscode_terraform_plan.png

You can always get the `terraform output` values again by invoking from the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform output

From the AWS Console, Services => INSTANCES => Instances. Select the Big-IP1 instance.

.. image:: ./images/19_aws_console_ec2.png
  :scale: 50%
  
Select the [Status Checks] tab below. Note the System Status Checks and Instance Status Checks are both "initializing".

.. image:: ./images/20_aws_console_bigip1_status_check.png
  :scale: 50%

Do the same for Big-IP2.

.. image:: ./images/21_aws_console_bigip2_status_check.png
  :scale: 50%

.. attention::

  Do not proceed until both the System Status Checks and Instance Status Checks for both Big-IP1 and Big-IP2 announce **...reachability check passed** in green!
