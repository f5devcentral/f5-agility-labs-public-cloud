What is F5 Telemetry Streaming
================================================================================
**F5 BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming (TS)** enables you to declaratively aggregate, normalize, and forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to a consumer application. BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming is an iControl LX Extension delivered as a TMOS-independent RPM file, and uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. To use BIG-IP TS, you POST a single JSON declaration to BIG-IP TSâ€™s declarative REST API endpoint.
