What is F5 Telemetry Streaming?
================================================================================

**Telemetry Streaming (TS)** is an iControl LX Extension that enables you to aggregate, normalize, and forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to a consumer application. It is delivered as a TMOS-independent RPM file.

Telemetry Streaming uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. To use TS, you POST a single JSON declaration to the BIG-IP's TS REST API endpoint.
